# Final_Year_Project-GoldenEye
Final Year final Project for an attendance monitoring application using Raspberry Pi System


On the Raspberry Pi 3, face recognition can be accomplished by combining hardware and software elements. Here is a general description of the procedure:
    
    1.	Hardware setup: The Raspberry Pi 3 needs to be configured with a camera module that can take good pictures as the first step. The Pi should be turned on and             linked to a display before the camera module is connected to its CSI connection.
    
    2.	Software installation: To perform face recognition on the Pi, you must next install the necessary software. OpenCV is a common library for this use.

    3.	Face detection: Once the software has been installed, the photographs that have been recorded must first be examined for faces. The OpenCV library, which offers         pre-trained models for face detection, can be used for this. These models employ machine learning techniques to spot patterns in the image data and pinpoint             regions where faces are most likely to be present.

    4.	Face recognition: The final stage is to identify faces that have been found in the photographs. A method known as individual faces can be used to accomplish             this, which entails building a mathematical model of each face and comparing it to a database of recognized faces. Machine learning algorithms are frequently             used in this procedure since they may be taught on a dataset of labeled photographs to identify various people.
    
    5.	Output: At the very least, the facial recognition system's output can be viewed on the Pi's screen or forwarded to a distant server for additional processing.
